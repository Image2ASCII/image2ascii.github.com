	<p>Team members: Neil Napier, Jeni Bath, Ed Kellett</a>
	<p>Converts images (and, eventually, animations and videos and such) into ASCII art representations which can be displayed by a web browser. GitHub page <a href="http://github.com/image2ascii/ascii">here</a>.</p>
	<p>This page will probably turn into a blog type thing as and when there is anything to report. Right now, all you need to know is that you can clone our repo using the link above, and that the code there can be compiled using Maven (or any IDE that supports it).</p>
